                <p align="justify">Residing in the upper echelon of supercar stature is Ferrari’s fastest and most technologically advanced car, the LaFerrari. Boastings an extremely powerful 6.3 liter V12 and further supplemented by an electric motor, The LaFerrari It
                    is the first of what will be many production cars to emerge from Maranello with a hybrid drivetrain. As with all special series vehicle, production are extremely limited. Only 499 of the worlds most dedicated Ferraristas were given
                    the opportunity to own a LaFerrari, with a 500th car auctioned off at Finali Mondiali to benefit the reconstruction of Central Italy in the aftermath of the 2016 earthquakes.

                <h2 class="header2">A Closer Look Into the LaFerrari</h2>
                <p align="justify">The cockpit of the LaFerrari is a far departure from traditional road cars; it is more evocative of its motorsports origins but retains the essential driver conveniences. The most notable design feature is that the seat is fixed in position
                    and instead the steering wheel and pedal box adjust to meet the driver’s hands and feet. Secondly, all the mission-critical controls are placed directly in front of the driver, with secondary controls located on the door panel.
                    <p align="justify"><img class="pic1" src="images/laferrari-front.jpg" alt="audi" width="270" height="189" /> <strong>Power train</strong> <br><br>LaFerrari is outfitted with an ingeniously packaged 788bhp V12 engine that is paired with a 160bhp electric
                        motor to produce an astonishing power output of 949bhp. The electric motor is mainly utilized at low speeds, which allowed Ferrari engineers to optimize the combustion engine for high-speed performance. By utilizing numerous technological
                        advancements from their F1 know-how, the engineers were able to achieve unparalleled efficiency and power output. Situated between the engine and motor is a 7-speed, dual clutch gearbox that boasts the fastest shift times of any
                        system to date. All this has been efficiently packaged with no impact on overall dimensions or wheelbase, and actually lowered the center of gravity of the vehicle..</p>
